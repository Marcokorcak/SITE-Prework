2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 

After completing the pre-work I can say that there were numerous challenges I faced. One challenged I encountered was making sure that the program was user friendly and served its purpose properly. In order to overcome this problem I made sure that the instructions were clear, the color scheme of the website was not overwhleming and that the user was in control of certain aspects. My goal was to make a program that is enjoyable and simple yet complex. I aimed at making the website have a theme which is code based since the images all realted to coding. I decided to do this to make the program more uniform and visualy pleasing but not overwhelming.  Apart from the issue of making the program user friendly, technical issues that I encountered was implementing other optional features such as adding images to the buttons, adding audio files and changing the patern of the sequence. Adding images and audio files technically was not difficult but it diid requore me to leave my comfort zone and learn how to achieve these tasks. I had to look at various resources in order to not only make these aspects work but also understand how they work. Moreover, creating the random sequence generator took a lot of trial and error to fully implament and achieve.
